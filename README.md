CAN DATA Sniffer Full Stack Project <br>
<br>
This project provides a means to send/receive the CAN-Bus traffic in a car using Arduino ESP32 by Lilygo T-CAN485 <br>
The first problem I encountered when working with the CAN-Bus was logging the date I get from the bus, there is a lot of it, it is different, and it needed to be sorted correctly. <br>
There is an option on the Internet to buy a ready-made project, called CAN-Hacker, it costs about 450 euros, and i use its example I was able to assemble a similar visual GUI for working with the can-bus.
