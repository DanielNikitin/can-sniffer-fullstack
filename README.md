CAN DATA Sniffer Full Stack Project <br>
<br>
This project provides a means to send/receive the CAN-Bus traffic in a car using Arduino ESP32 by Lilygo T-CAN485. <br>
First problem was with logging the date I get from the CAN-Bus, there is a lot of it, it is different, and need to be displayed and sorted correctly. <br>
<br>
To implement the GUI, I looked at similar devices for working with CAN-bus, and learned their operating principle, date display, and assembled my own working version from other ready-made open-source options. <br>
